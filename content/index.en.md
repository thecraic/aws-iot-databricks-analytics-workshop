### Welcome

In this workshop, you will learn about the different components of AWS IoT Analytics. You will configure AWS IoT Core to ingest stream data from the AWS Device Simulator, build an analytics pipeline using AWS IoT Analytics, visualize the data using Amazon QuickSight, and perform machine learning using Jupyter Notebooks. Join us, and build a solution that helps you perform analytics on appliance energy usage in a smart building and forecast energy utilization to optimize consumption. This workshop is an adaptation of the AWS Sample: IoT Analytics Workshop, available in https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-iot-analytics-workshop. The expected duration of this workshop is two (2) hours, and the target audience are data engineers, data scientist, IoT application developers, and data analysts interested in collecting, processing, analyzing, and visualizing data generated from IoT devices. To develop this workshop properly, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of CloudFormation templates, JSON format, SQL, and Python.

### Learning Outputs
- Deploy Device Simulator
- Build an IoT Analytics Channel
- Visualize IoT data using Amazon Quicksight
- Use Machine Learning for IoT using Jupyter Notebooks in Amazon Sagemaker
