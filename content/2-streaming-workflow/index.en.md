### Streaming data workflow

In this chapter, you are going to simulate the generation of IoT data and to build a stream analytics pipeline to collect, process, and analyse the data flowing through the pipeline. To do so, you are going to use the following solution and services:

- [IoT Device Simulator](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/iot-device-simulator/): This solution enables customers to build a large fleet of virtual connected devices (widgets) from a user-defined template and simulate those widgets publishing data at regular intervals to AWS IoT. 
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/): An object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance
- [AWS IoT Analytics](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-analytics/): A fully-managed service that makes it easy to run and operationalize sophisticated analytics on massive volumes of IoT data without having to worry about the cost and complexity typically required to build an IoT analytics platform.
