### Streaming data workflow

In this chapter, you are going to simulate the generation of IoT data and to build a stream analytics pipeline to collect, process, and analyse the data flowing through the pipeline. To do so, you are going to use the following solution and services:

- [IoT Device Simulator](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/iot-device-simulator/): This solution enables customers to build a large fleet of virtual connected devices (widgets) from a user-defined template and simulate those widgets publishing data at regular intervals to AWS IoT. 
- [AWS IoT Core S3](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/): AWS IoT Core lets you connect billions of IoT devices and route trillions of messages to AWS services without managing infrastructure.
- [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/): Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a serverless streaming data service that makes it easy to capture, process, and store data streams at any scale.
