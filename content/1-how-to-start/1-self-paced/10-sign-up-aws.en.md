### Sign Up for AWS

When you sign up for Amazon Web Services (AWS), your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS, including Lake Formation. You are charged only for the services that you use. If you have an AWS account already, skip to the next task. If you don't have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one.

#### To create an AWS account

1. Open https://aws.amazon.com and then choose Create an AWS Account.
