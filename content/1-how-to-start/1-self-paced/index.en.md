### Self Paced Lab

Before starting this AWS Lake Formation workshop, you need to create a few AWS resources. In this chapter, you configure those required AWS resources using AWS CloudFormation and then you work on the labs.

If you've already signed up for Amazon Web Services (AWS), you can jump to the [next section](/1-how-to-start/3-cfn-template). If you haven't signed up for AWS account yet, or if you need assistance, complete the following tasks to get set up your AWS account for the workshop:

* [Sign Up for AWS](/1-how-to-start/1-self-paced/10-sign-up-aws)
* [Create an IAM User](/1-how-to-start/1-self-paced/20-create-iam-user)
